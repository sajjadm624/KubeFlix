 Project Idea: "KubeFlix" – A Netflix Clone Microservice App on Kubernetes with CI/CD, Monitoring, and IaC
Why this?
Microservices: Shows you understand distributed architecture

Kubernetes: Must-have skill, especially if you're going for CKA

CI/CD: Jenkins/GitHub Actions + ArgoCD/FluxCD = gold

IaC: Terraform + Helm/Ansible for deployment = next level

Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki = production-grade

🧱 Tech Stack
Area	Tool
Containerization	Docker
Orchestration	Kubernetes (k3d/minikube locally)
CI/CD	GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
IaC	Terraform for infrastructure + Helm for K8s apps
Monitoring	Prometheus + Grafana
Logging	Loki
Secrets	Sealed Secrets or HashiCorp Vault
App	Sample Node.js or Python microservices (like user, movie, auth, recommendation)
GitHub Repo	README with architecture diagrams, scripts, CI badges

🧭 Step-by-Step Plan
We'll start with the basics and then scale it out:

Set up repo + basic microservice in Docker

Dockerize and deploy it to minikube/k3d

Add Helm chart for deployment

Set up GitHub Actions to build & push images

Deploy via ArgoCD

Add monitoring stack

Configure IaC with Terraform (cloud-ready infra)

Add docs: README, diagrams, badges
